# Integrate Okta as a third party key manager for APIM

This Okta keymanager implementation allows you to integrate the WSO2 API Store with an external Identity and Access Management (IAM) 
by using the Okta OAuth Authorization Server, which is an open source IAM, to manage the OAuth clients and tokens required 
by WSO2 API Manager. We have a sample client implementation that consumes APIs exposed by Okta OAuth.
